## Docker containers

Building the docker container can be done using (with `~/Desktop/ANUCourses/Honours/honours` as the pwd):

```sh
docker build -t radware .
```

Running the container can be done with (again with `~/Desktop/ANUCourses/Honours/honours` as the pwd):

```sh
docker run -it --rm -v ~/Desktop/ANUCourses/Honours/honours/rw05:/rw05 radware /bin/bash
```

In the above command:

`-it` makes the container run interactively.
`--rm` means that the container shuts down after it has been exited.
`-v local:cont` mounts the `local` directory into the path `cont` within the container.
`/bin/bash` is the command that the container executes in the shell - in this case it is just giving us a bash shell.

`touch f` will create an empty file (that is not of any type) called `f`.

Files that are created using touch within the container directory will persist into the local directory.

To exit the container, use `exit`.
